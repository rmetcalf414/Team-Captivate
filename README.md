# Team-Captivate

The following repository is created to support the 2019 Spring Torrence Learning Cohort focused on xAPI.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to write a reusable wrapper in javascript that makes using xAPI with Captivate and LMS mounted captivate courses a breeze. I have done many of these things listed below extensively, but always hard code each project to finish quickly and meet specific project specs.  The real answer is to write a wrapper that is well thought out and set up intuitively so that it can be reused.  If I can reuse it, so too should the rest of the world using Captivate.
